Steve purchases a $10$-year zero-coupon bond for $\$400$ and has par value of  $\$1,000$. Find the yield rate convertible semiannually that would be earned by Steve.

**Answer**

$P = 400$

$F = 1000$

$n = 10$ years


Suppose $i$ is the effective annual yield rate.  Observe that

\begin{align*}
P &= F \cdot (1+i)^{-n}\\
400 &= 1000 \cdot (1+i)^{-10}
\end{align*}

gives positive $i = 0.095958$.

Suppose $i^{(2)}$ is the yield rate convertible semiannualy. We have the relation

\begin{align*}
(1+i) &= \left(1+\frac{i^{(2)}}{2}\right)^2\\
(1+0.095958) &= \left(1+\frac{i^{(2)}}{2}\right)^2\\
\end{align*}

Which result in $i^{(2)} = 0.0937603$.

$\therefore$  the yield rate convertible semiannually is given by $i^{(2)} \approx 9.38\%$
