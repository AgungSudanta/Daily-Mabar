An investor purchases a $26$-week T-bill with face value $\$10,000$ for $\$X$ and earns an annual effective rate of $4.17\%$. Determine $X$.

**Answer**

$F = 10000$

$P = X$

$i = 4.17\%$ effective annually

$n = 26$ weeks

Observe that assuming $26$ weeks equal to half a year, we have $n = 0.5$ years

\begin{align*}
P &= F \cdot (1+i)^{-n}\\
X &= 10000 \cdot(1+4.17\%)^{-0.5}\\
&= 9797.8022
\end{align*}

$\therefore$ $X = 9797.8022$
