John buys a $13$-week T-bill with par value $\$10,000$ at a simple discount rate of $7.5\%$. What price did he pay for the bond?

**Answer**

$F = 10000$

$n = 13$ week

$d = 7.5\%$, simple, assuming effective annualy

Suppose P is the price paid for the bond. Observe that

\begin{align*}
(1-d) &= \left(1 - d_{(52)} \right)^{52}\\
d_{52} &= 0.00149814
\end{align*}

where $d_{(52)} is the discount rate effective weekly. Thus we have

\begin{align*}
P &= F \cdot (1-n\cdot d_{(52)})\\
&= 10000 \cdot (1-13\cdot 0.00149814)\\
&= 9805.2418
\end{align*}

$\therefore$ The price paid for the bond is $\$ 9805.2418$
