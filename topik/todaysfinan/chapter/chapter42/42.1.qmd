A zero bond will pay $\$1000$ at the end of $10$ years, and is currently selling for $\$500$. What is the annual return earned by the purchaser?

**Answer**

$P = 500$

$C = 1000$

$n = 10$ years

Observe that

\begin{align*}
P &= C \cdot (1+i)^{-n}\\
500 &= 1000 \cdot (1+i)^{-10}\\
\end{align*}

gives $i = 0.071773$ or $i =-2.0718$. 

$\therefore$ Since the return must be positive, we have $i \approx 7.18\%$
