For what values of a and b is the function $u(x, t) = e^{at}\sin bx$ a solution to the heat equation $$u_t = ku_{xx}$$

Answer

Differentiating $u(x, t) = e^{at}\sin bx$ respect to $t$ and $x$ will result in $$u_t = ae^{at}\sin bx$$ $$u_{xx} = -b^2e^{at}\sin bx$$
Substituting into the heat equation will result in $$ae^{at}\sin bx = -kb^2e^{at}\sin bx$$
Thus any arbitrary $a,b\in\mathbb{R}$ with $a = -kb^2, \; k \in \mathbb{R}$ is a valid value so that $u(x, t) = e^{at}\sin bx$ a solution to the heat equation
