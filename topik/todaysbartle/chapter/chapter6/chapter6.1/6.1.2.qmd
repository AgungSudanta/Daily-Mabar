Show that $f(x) : =x^{1/3}$, $x \in \mathbb{R}$, is not differentiable at $x = 0$

Answer

It will be shown that $f$ is not differentiable at $x = 0$ by contradiction

Assume $f$ is differentiable at $x = 0$, then by Carath\'eodory's Theorem it follows that there exist a continuous function $\varphi : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ at $c = 0$ such that $f(x) - f(0) = \varphi(x)(x-0) \; \forall x \in \mathbb{R}$

If $x=0$, then it follows that any functions $\varphi$ will satisfy $f(x) - f(0) = \varphi(x)(x-0)$

If $x \neq 0$, then it follows that $\varphi(x) = \frac{f(x)}{x} = \frac{1}{x^{2/3}}$

Notice that $\displaystyle{\lim_{x \to 0}} \; \varphi(x) = \infty$, thus we can't define $\varphi(0)$ such that $\varphi$ continuous at $c =0$

Therefore our assumption does not true, thus $f$ is not differentiable at $x = 0$
