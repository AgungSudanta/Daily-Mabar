Let $a < b < c$. Suppose that $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, that $g$ is continuous on $[b, c]$, and that $f(b) = g(b)$. Define $h$ on $[a,c]$ by $h(x) := f(x)$ for $x \in [a, b]$ and $h(x) = := g(x)$ for $x \in [b,c]$. Prove that $h$ is continuous on $[a, c]$

Answer

Preliminary Analysis

Notice that $h(x) = \begin{cases}
    f(x) & x \in [a,b] \\
    g(x) & x \in [b,c]
\end{cases}$. 

Thus for $[a,b]$, $h$ continuous because $f$ continuous, and for $[b,c]$, $h$ continuous because $g$ continuous. Also, because $f(b) = g(b)$, then it follows that $h(b) = f(b) = g(b)$ which implies that $h$ continuous at $x = b$. Therefore $h$ continuous on $[a,c]$ \\

Formal Proof

$h$ continuous on $[a,c]$ because $h$ continuous on $[a,b]$ and $[b,c]$
