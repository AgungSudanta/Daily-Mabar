Let $f$ and $g$ be Lipschitz functions on $A$ (a). Show that the sum $f + g$ is also a Lipschitz function on $A$

(b). Show that if $f$ and $g$ are bounded on $A$, then the product is a Lipshictz function on $A$

(c). Give an example of a Lipschitz function $f$ on $[0, \infty)$ such that it's square $f^2$ is \textit{not} a Lipschitz function

Answer

(a). It will be shown that $f + g$ is also a Lipschitz function on $A$

```         
Because $f$ and $g$ is a Lipschitz function on $A$, then by definition
$$\exists K > 0 \ni |f(x) - f(c)| \leq K|x - c| \; \forall x,c \in A$$
\begin{center}
    and
\end{center}
$$\exists L > 0 \ni |g(x) - g(c)| \leq L|x - c| \; \forall x,c \in A$$

From the inequalty, we will have $$|(f(x) + g(x)) - (f(c) + g(c))| \leq |f(x) - f(c)| + |g(x) - g(c)| \leq (K + L)|x - c| \; \forall x,c \in A$$

Therefore $f + g$ is also a Lipschitz function on $A$ by definition because $\exists M > 0$ where $M = K + L$ such that $|(f(x) + g(x)) - (f(c) + g(c))| \leq M|x - c| \; \forall x,c \in A$ \\
```

(b). It will be shown that if $f$ and $g$ are bounded on $A$, then the product is a Lipshictz function on $A$

```         
Because $f$ and $g$ is a Lipschitz function on $A$, then by definition
$$\exists K > 0 \ni |f(x) - f(c)| \leq K|x - c| \; \forall x,c \in A$$
\begin{center}
    and
\end{center}
$$\exists L > 0 \ni |g(x) - g(c)| \leq L|x - c| \; \forall x,c \in A$$

We also know that $f$ and $g$ is bounded on $A$, thus
$$\exists K_1 > 0 \ni |f(x)| \leq K_1 \; \forall x \in A$$
\begin{center}
    and
\end{center}
$$\exists L_1 > 0 \ni |g(x)| \leq L_1 \; \forall x \in A$$

Notice that
\begin{align*}
    |f(x)g(x) - f(c)g(c)| & = |f(x)g(x) - g(x)f(c) + g(x)f(c) - f(c)g(c)| \\
    & = |g(x)(f(x) - f(c)) - f(c)(g(x) - g(c))| \\
    & \leq |g(x)||f(x) - f(c)| + |f(c)||g(x) - g(c)| \\
    & \leq L_1K|x-c| + K_1L|x-c| \\
    & = (L_1K + K_1L)|x-c|
\end{align*}

Therefore $fg$ is also a Lipschitz function on $A$ by definition because $\exists M > 0$ where $M =(L_1K + K_1L)$ such that $|(f(x)g(x)) - (f(c)g(c))| \leq M|x - c| \; \forall x,c \in A$ \\
```

(c). Let $f(x) = x$. It is trivially follow that $f$ is Lipschitz function on $[0, \infty)$. It will be shown that $f^2(x) = x^2$ is not a Lipschitz function on $[0, \infty)$ by contradiction

```         
Let $A := [0, \infty)$ and assume that $f^2$ is a Lipschitz function on $A$. Then it must follow that $\exists K > 0 \ni |x^2 - c^2| \leq K|x-c| \; \forall x,c \in A$

Notice that $|x^2 - c^2| = |x-c||x+c|$, and because $x,c \in A$ it follows that $x + c = |x+c|$ thus $|x^2 - c^2| = |x-c|(x+c)$. Because $A$ does not have an upper bound, then $x + c$ also does not have an upper bound, thus we can't choose $K > 0$ such that $x + c \leq K$ which contradicts our assumption that $|x^2 - c^2| \leq K|x-c|$

Therefore our assumption must be false, which means $f^2$ is not a Lipschitz function on $A$
```
