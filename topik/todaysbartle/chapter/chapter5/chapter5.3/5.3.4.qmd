Show that every polynomial of odd degree with real coefficients has at least one real root

Answer

It will be shown that every polynomial of odd degree with real coefficients has at least one real root

Let $p:I \to \mathbb{R}$ be an odd degree polynomial. It can be shown that $p$ is continuous on any real-valued interval. If n is odd, then $x^n \leq 0 \; \forall x \leq 0$. Thus we can choose $a \in I$ and $a \leq 0$ such that $p(a) < 0$ for big enough $a$. With similiar reasoning, we can choose $b \in I$ and $b \geq 0$ such that $p(b) > 0$. Thus $p(a) < 0 < p(b)$, which by Intermediate Value Theorem guaranteed the existence of $c \in I \ni f(c) = 0$
